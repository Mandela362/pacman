## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pacman-clone.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pacman-clone
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.

## Game Mechanics

- **Pac-Man Movement**: Pac-Man moves in the direction specified by the player. The game wraps around the grid, so if Pac-Man moves off one side, he reappears on the opposite side.
- **Ghost Movement**: Ghosts move randomly around the grid, changing direction when they hit the edge of the grid.
- **Dot Collection**: Dots are placed on the grid, and Pac-Man collects them by moving over them. Each dot collected increases the score by 1.
- **Collision Detection**: If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, the game ends.

## Audio

The game features simple 8-bit sound effects:

- **Dot Collection Sound**: A short, high-pitched sound plays when Pac-Man collects a dot.
- **Game Over Sound**: A low-pitched sound plays when the game ends.

## Game Over

When Pac-Man collides with a ghost, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed. The player's final score is shown, and they have the option to restart the game.

## Restarting the Game

After a game over, the player can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button. This resets the grid, Pac-Man's position, the ghosts' positions, and the score.
